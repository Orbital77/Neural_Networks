# Neural_Networks

# Objective
  This project aims to create a functional and easy to implement deep learning model using the C programming language.
Modules may eventaully be created in python to help format input data, but the main program will use C.

# Progress
  So far, the algorithm only uses a ReLU function for each hidden layer, and a softmax function for the output layer.
  We are currently working on calculating loss and implementing a way to optimize the weights and biases.
